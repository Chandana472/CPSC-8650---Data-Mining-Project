# Predicting Hearing Thresholds from Brain MRI Images

This project aims to develop and evaluate multiple computational approaches to predict subjects' hearing thresholds at two pure-tone frequencies using gray matter images from Brain MRI scans. The task involves training different machine learning models and deep learning techniques to predict hearing thresholds and comparing their performance using various evaluation metrics.

## Problem Overview
We are provided with a dataset that includes:
- Gray matter images from Brain MRI scans.
- Associated hearing thresholds for each subject at two different pure-tone frequencies.

The objective is to develop prediction models that can accurately estimate the hearing thresholds based on the MRI images and then evaluate these models using performance metrics such as mean squared error (MSE), correlation coefficient, and others.

## Goals
1. Train and compare at least three different prediction models:
   - Traditional machine learning models (e.g., Random Forest, SVM)
   - Deep learning models (e.g., CNN)
   
2. Evaluate the models' performance using appropriate metrics (e.g., MSE, correlation).
   
3. Write a technical report discussing the methods used and the results obtained from the performance analysis.

THE PROBLEM

Hearing loss is a medical issue that affects many people around the world. It can be a result of
many different factors such as infection, loud noise, or various medical conditions. Metabolic
and sensory components have been linked to age-related hearing loss
(https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35064426/). Brain MRIs are used to take images of the brain
for various medical purposes. From these MRIs, gray matter images can be created using
specialized processing techniques. These gray matter images can be used to monitor the brain
and the areas associated with hearing loss.
Hearing loss is measured with pure tones. It uses the quietest sound, in decibels, a person can
hear. The severity of the hearing loss is measured through the lowest decibel the person can
hear.
Various data mining techniques can be used to analyze the gray matter images to predict
hearing thresholds. The dataset includes the gray matter image and its two corresponding pure
tone frequencies, PT 500 and PT 4000. Three different data mining techniques were trained to
predict the PT 500 and PT 4000 values for the gray matter images.
